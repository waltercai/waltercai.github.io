                  <p>
                      Hi! I'm Walter, a software engineer at Snowflake (starting Novembeer 2021) where I work on the neverending problem of query optimization.
                      I have a broad interest in data management with particular focus on multijoin processing, and data sketching.
                      I make data systems less reliant on heuristics, instead favoring robust theoretical foundations.
                  </p>

                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>
                <p>
                    I graduaed with a PhD in query optimization from the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/"> University of Washington
                    Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a> where
                    I was fortunate to be advised by Professors <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~suciu/">Dan Suciu</a>,
                    and <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/magda">Magdalena Balazinska</a>.
                    I was a member of the databases research <a href="http://db.cs.washington.edu/">group</a>.
                    My thesis was titled <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf">Novel Data Summaries for Join Query Optimization</a>.
                  </p>.
                <p>
                    Previously, I attended the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin</a> completing
                    a Master's in CS where I worked with <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/">Prof. AnHai Doan</a>.
                    Even earlier, I studied mathematics at <a href="https://www.math.cornell.edu/m/">Cornell University</a>,
                    graduating summa cum laude in 2014.
<!--                     During my undergrad I participated in two REU's at Rutgers <a href= "http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/">DIMACS</a>,
                    and UCLA <a href ="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/">IPAM</a>.
                    Before coming to Seattle I interned for Bayesian machine learning startup,
                    <a href="https://gamalon.com/">Gamalon</a>.
                    During my PhD I've had further opportunities to intern and collaborate with several industry leaders.
                    At <a href= "https://www.google.com/">Google</a> I worked with the engineers in Youtube data
                    designing and implementing distributed approximate quantile sketching algorithms.
                    I also ran experiments for distinct value estimation that influenced design choices
                    within Procella following the conclusion of my internship.
                    At Microsoft Research I worked in the
                    <a href= "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-management-exploration-and-mining-dmx/">DMX</a>
                    group on a collaborative team headed by
                    <a href= "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/philbe/">Phil Bernstein</a>
                    and <a href= "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wentwu/">Wentao Wu</a>
                    investigating multiquery optimization over streams.
                    A tangential project branching from this internship developed into a patent application and VLDB paper.
                    Most recently I interned at <a href= "https://research.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> working with
                    <a href= "https://research.tableau.com/user/daniel-ting">Daniel Ting</a>.
                    The internship again resulted in a patent application and the collabortion is ongoing. -->
